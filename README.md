# Tokyo Olympics Data

This project explores the data engineering process using Azure's platform, focusing on building familiarity with Azure services beyond Synapse Analytics. It starts with a Kaggle dataset, transitioning through data ingestion and transformation using Azure Data Factory and Databricks, to analytics with Azure Synapse Analytics. The project culminates in visualizations with Tableau due to platform compatibility issues with Power BI. This hands-on experience aims to deepen understanding of Azure's data services, showcasing a practical approach to designing data pipelines and extracting insights.
