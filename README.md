# End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This project is an Azure-based data engineering project, focusing on the entire data pipeline from ingestion to visualization. It starts with data preprocessing, leveraging Azure Data Factory for ingestion and Databricks for transformation. The project demonstrates effective use of Azure's ecosystem, emphasizing learning and skill development within Azure services. Key components include handling Kaggle datasets, data transformation, analytics with Azure Synapse, and visualization with Tableau due to compatibility considerations. This project serves as an introductory exploration into Azure platform capabilities, data pipeline design, and data insight generation.
